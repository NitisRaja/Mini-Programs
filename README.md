This repo serves as a structured collection of various programs I've written over time, ranging from personal practice, trials to production work.
It acts as a,
- Reference Library - an archive of solutions
- Progress Chronicle - a record of my evolving problem-solving approaches and code quality

* standard practices & style

I've also included notable efficient solutions alongside for comparison and learning.
